# Alzheimer-Prediction-Model
Early and accurate diagnosis provides opportunities for an Alzheimer patient and their family to consider 
financial planning, enroll in clinical trials, and anticipate care needs. therefore, we need 
to predict the possibility of someone having an Alzheimer before it’s too late to 
manage it. This project is built in order to do that by studying the Alzheimer’s features dataset that will help in trying 
to find a relation between the attributes and their effect on each other and the goal is to find a model that 
predicts whether someone has Alzheimer or not by analyzing the data objects.

In this project:
- data cleaning (checking null, remove outliers).
- data transformation (encoding, normalization).
- classification.
- k-means clustering.
- evaluation and visualization.
